**Virtual Shop 2017**

Today we learnt about making a virtual shop with expensive pieces of clothing that works, so that if you were at a till, all you would have to press would be the item on a drop down list and the quantity. This also included discounts.

**What I Learned?**

I learnt that what we achieved last half term is useful for creating everyday things. We included the =vlookup( tool to get the machine to find the price of the item. I also learnt a few extra techniques which will help me when it comes to more difficult parts of IT.

**What Have I Achieved?**

So far we have only started our shop (mine a souvenir shop) and so have only really done a few things. I have achieved a simple =vlookup( on the price so far.
