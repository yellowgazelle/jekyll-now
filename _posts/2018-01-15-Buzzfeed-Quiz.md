**Python Recap**

This lesson, we were looking at how to use 'loops', ‘lists’ and 'append.' We looked at the differences between using a ‘for’ loop and a ‘while’ loop which I now know how to do. Using lists, we were trying to be able to print a single part of the list in a program. We used the append function to change a list but without altering the variable, which I found useful.

I found this useful and found it relatively easy, although I had problems with the speed the lesson was moving at as it was a tad quick.

What did I learn?

I did not learn too much, because as soon it had been taught, I remembered it, so it was mainly to jog my memory. I did learn about range(), and that the start of the range is not counted, and so to get 1-10, you need to put 0-10, or you will end up with 2-10.
