Today we worked on decision trees and what an answer in a quiz would mean in the outcome. We looked at examples of these quizzes on Buzzfeed and worked out ways to program it. For example, if you score mostly A, then you would get a certain outcome. 

In this lesson I learnt the logic behind the game of backgammon, where the teacher won and then lost. He showed how the dice roll is random even though it seemed like the computer was cheating.
