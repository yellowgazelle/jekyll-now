**Functions**

Today we carried on with the Python recap and learnt a bit along the way. I found it interesting but at the same time confusing. I know remember that all functions start with the following code:

def coding(coding):

	code

	return code

These can be used when coding something that needs to be repeated many times, for example when we use the same question over and over again.

**What did I learn?**

I learnt the difference between a procedure and a function. If you ask your butler to tie up your lace, he will tie up your lace in a procedure. If, however, you ask him the same question in a function, he will tie up your lace and say "ok" or something like that. This is an excellent analogy from my teacher as it shows the exact difference between the two.

**Future Targets**

I wish to be able to use functions correctly in the coming weeks without help.
