**Python Recap**

This lesson, we were looking at how to use 'loops', ‘lists’ and 'append.' We looked at the differences between using a ‘for’ loop and a ‘while’ loop which I now know how to do. Using lists, we were trying to be able to print a single part of the list in a program. We used the append function to change a list but without altering the variable, which I found useful.

I found this useful and found it relatively easy, although I had problems with the speed the lesson was moving at as it was a tad quick.
