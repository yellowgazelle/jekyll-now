**Coding Spreadsheets**

**Welcome to the first blog of this year.**

So far this year in IT, we have been covering spreadsheets. We have been learning to code boxes so that they do certain things. The example we have been looking at is codes. For example, we write the alphabet down one column, and then next to that, another column, but this time with a keyword e.g zebra. We wrote the keyword at the top of the alphabet, and write the rest of the letters below that, but we only wrote them once i.e if the keyword were 'bubble', we would write it ‘bule’. Then we coded the boxes next to it so that it would find the letter next to the original. We mainly used =vlookup().

**What Have I Done?**

So far, I have been able to complete the keyword, and all of the coding used to translate the coded language into normal, letters and words. I still need to complete the concatenation.

**What Have I Learned?**

I've learnt the code needed to code a piece of text, and so if I needed to, I would be able to translate this blog into my code.
