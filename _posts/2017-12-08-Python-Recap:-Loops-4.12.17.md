**Python Recap: Loops**

Today we recapped the Codecadamy Python that we did last year, as most of it had been forgotten. We focussed on for and while loops.

**What did I learn?**

I did not learn too much, because as soon it had been taught, I remembered it, so it was mainly to jog my memory. I did learn about range(), and that the start of the range is not counted, and so to get 1-10, you need to put 0-10, or you will end up with 2-10. 

**EBIâ€¦**

Today's lesson was exciting and fun so I do not have many EBIs.
