**Starting The Quizzes**

Starting point: I started off with my quiz sheet written but without the knowledge needed to turn the questions into coding. This was later taught to me for me to complete the homework with.

Finishing point: I did not manage to complete the copy up of code from the quiz but now I know how to for homework.

Lesson Review: Today was the first lesson on creating the Buzzfeed quiz. I have decided to do a quiz about names. We started by looking at the board and being taken step by step what to do with the questions, and how to make a list in the shortest amount of code possible. This was using a variable called 'index' and ended up by having a list in which were many lists (this also helped save space). These lists were what turned out to be the questions asked. We ended the lesson by altering the code to be our own questions and answers. I will finish the job of copying my questions into the code for homework.

**What Will I Work On?**

I really need to develop my speed for next lesson because otherwise I will be behind. I needed to copy the questions into the code in the lesson but I did not as I did not work quickly enough. The habits I need to change are to stop looking at other people's computers as this will hinder my learning and make me slower. They do not have the answers that I am looking for.

***Which habits should I keep?*** I think I worked well by having a good understanding of what was being said and how to complete the task set. I normally listen attentively to what is being said and I did today, which boosted my learning.
